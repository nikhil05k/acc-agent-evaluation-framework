### ðŸ”‘ **Core Metrics for Evaluation**

1. **Ease of Setup & Use**

    - Installation simplicity

    - Documentation quality

    - Learning curve / boilerplate required

    - Default abstractions (agents, tools, workflows)

2. **LLM & Provider Compatibility**

    - Native support for multiple LLM providers

    - Ability to self-host (vLLM, Ollama, Local LLMs)

    - Support for multi-modal models (text, image, speech)

3. **Tooling & Integrations**

    - Built-in tools (search, code execution, APIs, memory, vector DBs)

    - Extensibility (ease of adding custom tools/adapters)

    - Ecosystem support (plugins, community contributions)

4. **Agent Orchestration Features**

    - Multi-agent collaboration support

    - State management (persistence, checkpoints, retries)

    - Control flows (sequential, parallel, hierarchical agents)

    - Scheduling & event-driven execution

5. **Memory & Knowledge Management**

    - Short-term context handling (conversation memory, buffer/window)

    - Long-term memory (databases, vector stores)

    - Support for knowledge graphs / RAG pipelines

6. **Performance & Scalability**

    - Latency (response times with/without orchestration)

    - Throughput (parallel requests, scaling across machines)
        
    - Resource utilization (compute efficiency, caching, batching)

7. **Observability & Debugging**

    - Logging & tracing (step-by-step agent reasoning)

    - Monitoring dashboards (token usage, cost tracking, latency)

    - Debugging utilities (replay runs, visualize graphs/flows)

8. **Testing & Evaluation Support**

    - Built-in unit/integration testing for agents

    - Support for eval frameworks (DeepEval, RAGAS, custom harnesses)

    - Determinism & reproducibility (seeded runs)

9. **Governance & Safety**

    - Guardrails (validation, filtering, moderation)

    - Human-in-the-loop support

    - Policy enforcement (e.g., prompt injection resistance, safety layers)

10. **Community & Maturity**

    - Open-source vs closed-source

    - Community adoption (GitHub stars, contributors, releases)

    - Roadmap & maintenance activity

11. **Cost efficiency**

    - Tokens per task
    - Ability to optimise calls
    - Roadmap & maintenance activity

12. **Enterprise Readiness**

    - Auth
    - RBAC
    - Deployment Guides
    - Kubernetes Support
