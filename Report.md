## üß™ Framework Findings

### **CrewAI**

* ‚úÖ Straightforward installation and usage (`pip install crewai`)
* ‚úÖ Broad LLM compatibility (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, etc.)
* ‚úÖ Built-in **Code Execution Tool** (`CodeInterpreterTool`)
* ‚úÖ **ResearchAgent** available with tools like `SerperDevTool`, `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` for web search
* ‚úÖ Multi-agent orchestration (Agents, Crews, Tasks)
* ‚úÖ Verbose logging for transparency during execution
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation sometimes lags behind rapid releases
* ‚úÖ Good set of prebuilt agent templates (Research, Analyst, Coder)

---

### **ADK (Google AI Development Kit)**

* ‚úÖ Seamlessly integrates with Gemini models
* ‚úÖ Provides **Built-in Code Execution Tool** (`BuiltInCodeExecutor`)
* ‚úÖ Provides **Google Search Tool**
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Session management is required (`create_session`), which adds setup steps but also gives explicit control over state
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Only one tool per agent is currently supported, which keeps the model simple but may limit complex workflows
* ‚úÖ Event stream API offers fine-grained visibility into intermediate steps
* Documentation is generally clear, though async vs sync examples may need harmonisation for smoother onboarding

---

### **AI Refinery SDK (Accenture)**

* ‚úÖ Simple installation (`pip install air`)
* ‚úÖ Strong focus on **enterprise readiness** ‚Äî supports Distiller orchestrators, YAML-driven configuration, and utility agents
* ‚úÖ Built-in **SearchAgent** available for integration into projects
* ‚úÖ Prebuilt agents (Search, Analytics, etc.) highlight an extensible approach to agent libraries
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Documentation improvement opportunity**:

    -   Docs show `dc.query("prompt")` as valid.
        
    -   Actual SDK requires keyword usage:
        
        ```python
        responses = await dc.query(query="prompt")
        
        ```
        
    -   Calling as shown in docs results in:
        
        ```
        TypeError: AsyncDistillerClient.query() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
        
        ```
        
  * This mismatch is a minor detail, but correcting it would help new developers avoid runtime errors and smooth adoption.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Error messages can be made more user-friendly (e.g. model not found currently returns a raw 404).
* ‚ùå No dedicated **Code Execution Tool** yet; code execution today would need to be handled externally.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Prebuilt agents sometimes respond with ‚Äúno access‚Äù even when defined ‚Äî an opportunity to enhance tool invocation reliability.
* ‚úÖ Positioned as an **enterprise orchestration platform**: RBAC, project-based agent management, and integration hooks are clear differentiators.

## üìå Recommendations

* **CrewAI**: Strong baseline for dev prototyping; continue refining docs as ecosystem grows.
* **ADK**: Excellent Gemini integration; could expand multi-tool agent support for more complex workflows.
* **AI Refinery SDK**:

  * **Docs**: Align examples with actual SDK signatures (e.g. `query(query="...")`) for smoother onboarding.
  * **Error Handling**: Improve clarity of error messages (e.g. provide descriptive errors for invalid models).
  * **Code Execution**: Adding a native execution tool would bring parity with competitors.
  * **Tool Invocation Reliability**: Provide stronger guarantees/controls to enforce tool usage when configured.
  * These refinements would further solidify AI Refinery‚Äôs position as a leading enterprise agent orchestration platform.
